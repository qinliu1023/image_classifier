# image_classifier

## Installation
This notebook should be ok to run with python 3 through Anocaonda, but would be faster if running it on GPU mode.

## Motivation
There is the trend that AI algorithms will be more and more deeply incorporated into our daily life through applications. I am taking this project as a practice and start of deep learning and AI application developing.


## Results
1. Trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers through Python Notebook. 
2. Deep neural network trained on the flower data set was converted into an application that others can use.
